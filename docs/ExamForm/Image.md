### Image specifications and uploading

1. Ensure that all photos (self, Photo ID) are of excellent quality and meet the specified parameters as per [Photo Specifications](https://gnecoe.github.io/Notices/Files/Photo.html).

2. Crop your personal photo into a square shape, ensuring even lighting and a neutral background, and crop the Photo ID photo to fit the rectangular dimensions of the ID card while maintaining clarity and compliance with ID guidelines.

3. It is advised to have well-processed images stored on your device. Avoid taking selfies; instead, consider going to a professional photographer or ask a friend who's good at photography.
